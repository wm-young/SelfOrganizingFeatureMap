# SelfOrganizingFeatureMap
Now that weâ€™re in the information age, data mining
is becoming more and more popular. Self-Organising Maps turns
out to be a great tool in manipulating large dimensional data
and projected it in a lower dimension that makes it easier to
understand. By using various forms of clustering techniques,
we are able to analysis large sets of data in hopes that some
hidden attribute of the data might be recognized. The number of
applications for a Self-Organizing map is practically endless and
in this paper we will discuss the basic problems with clustering as
well as see an application for clustering of images. Naturally, will
this algorithm their are various parameters that can be altered
to obtain various results in the final outcome. This paper will
explore some of these parameters and investigate their behaviour
and effect on the final resutls.
Key Terms - Self-Organizing map, clustering, image analysis.
